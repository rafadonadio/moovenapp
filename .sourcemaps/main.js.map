moovenapp\r\n * @description\r\n * Shipment Create Page is where Operators select sendings to ship.\r\n *      A selected sending and confirmed, converts to a shipment\r\n * To be listed as vacant a sending must be in status \"waitoperator\".\r\n *      Must be paid and enabled.\r\n * Sendings can be listed by \"date\" and \"map center\".\r\n * View is in realtime mode always, using firebase and geofire suscriptions\r\n *      UI auto updates upon changes in DB in realtime. \r\n * \r\n * LOGIC\r\n * 1. subscribe to \"_sendingsLiveGeofireDates\" (this.datesListSubs)\r\n *    each node represents a date (MM_DD) with at least 1 vacant sending\r\n *    add dates as element of the array\r\n *    by default:\r\n *      - element '0' of mapDate is set as dateSlug [MM_DD]\r\n *      - element '0' of mapCenter is set as map lat/lng\r\n * 2. Run Geofire\r\n *    at least one date must be available to start geofire\r\n *    parameters used to trigger geofire\r\n *      - dateSlug: used to set the DB reference\r\n *                  In the DB, each \"dateslug\" is a separate geofire list  \r\n *      - mapCenter: lat, lng and radius\r\n *                   used for query (geoFireQuery), tracks keys matching criteria   \r\n *    Two GeoCallbackRegistration are set:\r\n *      - geoFireRegIn: (key_entered) track when key is written to this geofire list\r\n *                      For each new element, another DB read is made to /sending/ID \r\n *                      to get sending Data\r\n *      - geoFireRegIn: (key_exited) track when key is removed from geofire list\r\n *                      For each removed element, Map/UI is updated deleting the sending \r\n * 3. Switch MapDate / MapCenter\r\n *    MapDate/MapCenter is changed/selected from UI\r\n *    Both Geofire GeoCallbackRegistration are closed (canceled)\r\n *    Gmap is reseted\r\n *    Geofire is re-started, with new Db Ref and new GeoCallbackRegistration\r\n */\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n    selector: 'page-shipment-create',\r\n    templateUrl: 'shipment-create.html',\r\n})\r\nexport class ShipmentCreatePage implements OnInit {\r\n\r\n    // operatorAuth flags\r\n    operatorAuthUnchecked:any;  \r\n    // account\r\n    accountSubs: Subscription;\r\n    account: UserAccount;\r\n    operator: UserAccountOperator;      \r\n    // aux\r\n    loader:any;     \r\n    // geofire\r\n    geoFire: any;\r\n    geoFireQuery: any;\r\n    geoFireRegIn: any;\r\n    geoFireRegOut: any;    \r\n    // maps dates\r\n    flagDatesInitiated: boolean;\r\n    flagDatesExist: boolean;\r\n    datesListSubs: Subscription;\r\n    datesList: Array<any>;\r\n    dateIndexSelected: number;\r\n    dateEditing: boolean;\r\n    mapDate: MapDate;  \r\n    // map center\r\n    mapCenterList: Array<MapCenter>;\r\n    mapCenterSelected: number;\r\n    mapCenterEditing: boolean;\r\n    mapCenter: MapCenter;\r\n    // map \r\n    map: any;\r\n    mapMarkers = {\r\n        list: [],\r\n        selected: ''\r\n    };\r\n    routeLine: any;\r\n    mapMarkerSelected: any;\r\n    // vacant sendings\r\n    vacants: Array<any>;\r\n    vacantsIndexList: Array<string>;\r\n\r\n    constructor(public navCtrl: NavController,\r\n        public gmapsService: GoogleMapsService,\r\n        public dateSrv: DateService,\r\n        public sendingSrv:SendingService,\r\n        public alertCtrl: AlertController,\r\n        public loaderCtrl: LoadingController,\r\n        public viewCtrl: ViewController,\r\n        public toastCtrl: ToastController,\r\n        private AuthSrv: AuthService,\r\n        private accountSrv: AccountService) {\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    ngOnInit() {   \r\n        console.groupCollapsed('SHIPMENT_CREATE INIT');\r\n        this.operatorAuthUnchecked = true;\r\n        this.setAccount()\r\n            .then(() => {                \r\n                // set mapCenter\r\n                this.mapCenterListSet();   \r\n                this.mapCenterSet(0);  \r\n                this.gmapReset();\r\n                // set mapDates: geofire\r\n                this.mapDatesReset();\r\n                this.mapDatesSubscribe();            \r\n            })\r\n            .catch(err => {\r\n                console.log('error', err);\r\n                this.showAlertAndCancel(\r\n                    'Error', \r\n                    'Ocurrió un error al validar tus credenciales como Operador, vuelve a intentarlo en unos momentos.'\r\n                );\r\n            })        \r\n        console.groupEnd();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    ionViewWillEnter() {      \r\n        console.groupCollapsed('ION_VIEW_WILL_ENTER');\r\n        this.flagDatesInitiated = false; \r\n        console.groupEnd();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    ionViewWillLeave() {\r\n        this.unsubscribe();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // navigation\r\n    goBack() {\r\n        this.navCtrl.setRoot(ShipmentsTabsPage);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private setAccount(): Promise<any> {\r\n        console.groupCollapsed('SET_ACCOUNT');\r\n        return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\r\n            let obs = this.accountSrv.getObs(true);\r\n            this.accountSubs = obs.subscribe((snap) => {\r\n                this.account = snap.val();\r\n                this.operator = this.account.operator;\r\n                this.operatorAuthUnchecked = false;\r\n                console.groupEnd();\r\n                resolve();\r\n            },\r\n            err => {\r\n                console.log(err);\r\n                console.groupEnd();\r\n                reject();\r\n            });\r\n        });\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * MANUAL RESET CONNECTION \r\n     * reset mapDatesSuscription and Geofire\r\n     */\r\n    manualReset() {\r\n        console.groupCollapsed('MANUAL_RESET');\r\n        this.showToast('REINICIANDO CONEXIÓN...
